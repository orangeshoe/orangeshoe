- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @orangeshoe
I'm currently interested in learning how I can use the latest version of Caja the way the older one did. I haven't found a file search, which was obvious in the previous version. I'm also having difficulty with image tags in FLAC files. Seems MP3s show the tagged images just like the old, but not FLAC. Any one know of fixes?
